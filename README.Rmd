## Introduction
The purpose of the `rbqmR` package is to provide a repository of r-based tools for the implementation of risk-based quality management.

Tools currently exist for

* Dynamic Quality Tolerance Limits (QTLs) using Bayesian Hierarchical Models (ongoing)
* Observed-Minus-Expected methodology (ongoing)

This package is a work-in-progress.

## Installation

You can install the development version of rbqmR from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("openpharma/rbqmR")
```

## Examples
### Dynamic QTLs

We use the example described on pages xx to xx Berry et al [@BERRY], modifying the context so that rather than being a meta analysis of several different trials, we consider the data to represent the performance of different sites within a single trial.  The exact metric being measured is immaterial, though it remains a summary of a binomial outcome.

```{r}
data(berrySummary)

berrySummary %>% kable(digits=c(0,0,0,2))
```

The central tenet of the QTL methodology implemented in `rbqmR` is not that a current trial should behave in a similar fashion to a "similar" historical or control trial, but rather that all sites within the current trial should behave in a similar way.  The justification for this assumption is that the trial's inclusion/exclusion criteria are designed to minimise heterogeneity amongst the study population (save for that induced by differences in treatment in comparative trials).

We fit the Bayesian Hierarchical Model described by Berry et al.

```{r, error=TRUE}
fitted <- berrySummary %>% 
            fitBayesBinomialModel(n=Subjects, r=Events)
```


### Observed - Expected Methodology
We generate some random data similar to that used by Gilbert [@GILBERT], after setting a seed for reproducibility.

In order to illustrate what happens when a QTL is breached, we set the probability that a participant reports an event to 0.13, even though the QTL process will assume the event rate is 0.10...

```{r}
set.seed(011327)

randomData <- tibble(
  Subject=1:400,
  Event=rbinom(400, 1, 0.13)
)
```

... and create an observed-expected table ...

```{r}
omeTable <- randomData %>% 
              createObservedMinusExpectedTable(
                timeVar = Subject,
                eventVar = Event,
                eventArray = 1,
                expectedRate = 0.1,
                maxTrialSize=400
              )
```

... and plot the corresponding graph.

```{r}
omeTable %>%
  createObservedMinusExpectedPlot()
```

We can see that the trial breached a warning limit.  When did this first happen?

```{r}
omeTable %>% 
  filter(Status !=  "OK") %>% 
  head(1) %>% 
  select(-contains("Action"), -SubjectIndex) %>% 
  kable(
    col.names=c("Subject", "Event", "Cumulative Events", "O - E", "Status", "Lower", "Upper"),
    caption="First breech of an action or warning limit"
  ) %>% 
  add_header_above(c(" "=5, "Warning Limits"=2))
```
