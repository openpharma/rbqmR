## Introduction
This document contains notes intended to assist developers of `rbqmR` to work in a consistent way.

It is a living document.

## Folders
### developerData
For the storage of datasets used to develop new functionality and to maintain current functionality.  It is *not* for data needed for unit testing.  This should be in `tests\testthat\testData`.

All files are in .Rbuildignore.  All files in `.developerData/private` are also in `.gitignore`.  So use `.developerData/private` for proprietary data needed for development.

### tests\testthat\testData
Used for data needed for unit testing.  This should not contain proprietary data you are unwilling or unable to share.
